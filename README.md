# MyInternalMinecraftClient
## A fork of InternalMinecraftClient
This fork of IMCC edits what the tooltips say as well as command syntax. If I ever learn C++ I might actually work on this client. We'll see

# Compiling
I'm nit sure how you compile this. I tried. IMCC's Github page had no instuctions, or releases for that matter, and the Information Superhighway was useless.
# Contributing
Fork the repo, edit it and submit a pull request. I will review the changes and maybe merge the repos!
